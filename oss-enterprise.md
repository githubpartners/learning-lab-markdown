# Welcome! 

Congratulations on taking the first steps to becoming an open source enterprise! This course will be your companion as you explore and develop the resources necessary to ramp up your teams and transform your organization's culture. Through a series of issues and pull requests, you'll create an open source kit: a repository that will house all resources for an open source program.

Throughout the course, you'll be prompted to have offline conversations with departments, teams, and individuals across your organization. To get the most out of this course, consider pausing as the bot prompts you to have these conversations and returning when you're ready. At the end of this course you'll have a fully functional repository with a trove of templates and guides you can use to kickstart your program.

## Complete the self assessment

As we begin our journey into preparing for open source, let's start with a few self assessments of where your open source program stands today.
1. Navigate to the [open source self assessments](https://githubtraining.github.io/oss-assessment/).
1. Take each of the assessments.
1. Jot down your level within each dimension.

# Establish program goals

After completing the self assessment, the next step is to establish a clear set of goals for your open source program.  Use the following matrix to guide the discussion:

| Dimension | Current Level | Goals |
| --------- | ----- | ----- |
| Consuming open source software |      |      |
| Contributing back to the open source projects you consume |      |      |
| Producing your own open source software |      |     |

### Levels within each dimension

![os-levels](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/58345546-d7b6b880-7e15-11e9-863b-803604593e43.png)

**Ad-hoc** - a new or undocumented process is uncontrolled, reactive and unpredictable, typically driven by individuals without coordination or communication. Success depends on individual heroics.

**Managed** - a process is partially documented, possibly leading to consistent results. Success depends on discipline.	

**Defined** - a process is documented, standardized, and integrated into other processes. Success depends on automation.	

**Measured** - the process is quantitatively managed. Success depends on measuring metrics against business goals.	

**Optimized** - the process is continually and reliably improving through both incremental and innovative changes. Success depends on reducing the risk of change.



## Step 1: Establish preliminary goals

The goals you set here are preliminary, you'll have an opportunity to formalize them later. 

### :keyboard: Action: Comment with goals 

1. Write your goals in this issue, or just type "done" to move on. 

<hr>
<h3 align="center">I'll respond when you comment on this issue.</h3>

You took an action I didn't expect. I was looking for you to {{ expected }}.
## Step 2: Update the README for your open source kit

This pull request adds a file called `README.md` to this open source kit. This repository is where people will come for help and information when they want to open source projects within your organization. The information in the `README.md` should help give those people what they're looking for.

This `README.md` is _not_ a template for others when open sourcing their projects. Instead, this provides guidelines for when to open source projects and how to do it.

The `README.md` already has some great information. Customize the document with more recommendations for your company and then merge.

It's a good idea to include links to other documents that you've created (or will create in the future). For example, add other links to things like your `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Then, others will know that the templates exist and should be used.

### :keyboard: Activity: Reflect on a README.md

1. Answer all of these questions:
   - What is the purpose of this repository?
   - Who should someone contact if they have questions?
   - How should someone make contact if they have questions?
   - What are the first steps to getting started open sourcing a project?
   - How does this repository relate to other projects and business goals?
2. Update the `README.md` in this pull request to reflect the information you want to include about your project.
3. When you're ready to move on, merge this pull request.

<hr>
<h3 align="center">I'll respond when you merge this pull request.</h3>
Great! Let's go to the [next pull request]({{ url }}).
It looks like you closed this pull request without merging, but I wasn't expecting that! Even if you want to edit the contents later, let's merge the pull request for now so we can continue with the course.

Reopen the pull request and merge it. I'll respond then. 
You took an action I didn't expect. I was looking for you to {{ expected }}.
## Step 3: Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` to your organization's open source repository

This pull request introduces a `CONTRIBUTING.md` template file.

This template should be used in all of your organization's repositories and be customized by the maintainers. The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file communicates expectations with contributors about how they can help contribute to the project.

The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file should be customized for each project as much as possible to be clear and helpful. If contributors aren't sure what to do, their contributions won't be as useful to the project. This often results in inconsistent contributions and longer than needed review time from maintainers before merging.  

If you're looking for inspiration, here are some great examples of `CONTRIBUTING.md` files from notable projects. :sparkles:
- [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [facebook/react](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) links out to separate documentation, but still gives the same important information
- [Microsoft/sqlopsstudio](https://github.com/Microsoft/sqlopsstudio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### :keyboard: Action: Improve the guide to contributing

1. Look through the examples listed above, and make note of qualities you like (or don't like) about each document.
2. Change the document in this pull request so it is a good template for all other repositories in your organization.
3. Commit directly to this branch. When you're ready to move on, merge this pull request.

<hr>
<h3 align="center">I'll respond when you merge this pull request.</h3>

Great! Let's go to the [next pull request]({{ url }}).
It looks like you closed this pull request without merging, but I wasn't expecting that! Even if you want to edit the contents later, let's merge the pull request for now so we can continue with the course.

Reopen the pull request and merge it. I'll respond then. 
You took an action I didn't expect. I was looking for you to {{ expected }}.
Great! Let's go to the [next step]({{ url }}).
Thanks for opening this PR! I wasn't expecting this PR, instead I was expecting a pull request titled: {{ expected }}.

Please review the last set of instructions and try opening a new pull request.
## Step 5: Add communication guidelines to your organization's open source repository

This pull request introduces a file for you to outline and define the communication guidelines. This goes beyond the normal `code-of-conduct` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Partners in this process

You will want to @ mention your communications department to craft the guidelines in this pull request. You will also want to share these communication guidelines with others as they open source and maintain their own projects.

### What communication guidelines are necessary?
There are a lot of nuanced behaviors that go into managing open source software. Use this document to explore how to handle more difficult and unclear territory, such as `code-of-conduct` violations or positive recognition to prolific contributors.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create communication guidelines
1. Edit this document to reflect the expectations for communication with open source software at your organization
2. Commit directly to this branch.
3. When you're ready to move on, merge this pull request.

<hr>
<h3 align="center">I'll respond when you merge this pull request.</h3>
Your code of conduct looks fantastic! Feel free to merge it if you like.

When you're ready to move on, go to the [next pull request]({{ url }}).
It looks like you closed this pull request without merging, but I wasn't expecting that! Even if you want to edit the contents later, let's merge the pull request for now so we can continue with the course.

Reopen the pull request and merge it. I'll respond then. 
You took an action I didn't expect. I was looking for you to {{ expected }}.
## Step 6: Add checklist to ISSUE_TEMPLATE

**tl;dr** When an individual or team is contemplating releasing a project as open source, there will be a number of steps for them to complete. The first step will be to open an issue in this repository. In this pull request, we will create an ISSUE_TEMPLATE which will contain the tracking checklist for releasing a project as open source and some key questions for them to consider.

### Partners in this process

You may want to @ mention the individuals responsible for legal, compliance, security and marketing to be your partners in this step.

### Using the checklist

**This checklist should be the one-stop-shop for open sourcing repositories in your organization.**

A great open source checklist:
- Is the canonical source of truth for the steps to be taken before open sourcing a project
- Contains appropriate links to enable project maintainers to complete the process with minimal support
- Includes appropriate information on the teams or individuals to mention at each stage of the process
- Demands 100% compliance. All of the boxes should be checked or an issue comment added about why a specific step isn't necessary BEFORE a project is released as open source.

### Activity: Create a checklist for new issues about open sourcing projects

This checklist will be a work in progress as you complete the other steps in this repository. We recommend that you keep this pull request open and add new links/steps as indicated in the process:

1. Directly on this branch, update the placeholder text in the `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` as appropriate for your organization.
1. Add links to documents that are external to this repository, like an employee IP agreement.
1. Add steps you will require maintainers to complete.
1. Remove steps you will not require maintainers to complete.
1. When you're ready to move on, merge this pull request.

<hr>
<h3 align="center">I'll respond when you merge this pull request.</h3>
Great! Let's go to the [next pull request]({{ url }}).
It looks like you closed this pull request without merging, but I wasn't expecting that! Even if you want to edit the contents later, let's merge the pull request for now so we can continue with the course.

Reopen the pull request and merge it. I'll respond then. 
You took an action I didn't expect. I was looking for you to {{ expected }}.
## Step 7: Maintainer's guide

This pull request adds a `maintainer_guide.md` to guide maintainers of open source projects. This could be included in a public-facing way, but may be best kept privately in this repository.

Use this document to formalize expectations for maintainers and help everyone learn how to maintain well.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a `MAINTAINERS_GUIDE.md` to your organization's open source repository
1. Update the `maintainer-guide.md` on this branch to reflect the support and guidance you want to give project maintainers at your organization.
1. When you're ready to move on, merge this pull request.

<hr>
<h3 align="center">I'll respond when you merge this pull request.</h3>
Great! Let's go to the [next pull request]({{ url }}).
It looks like you closed this pull request without merging, but I wasn't expecting that! Even if you want to edit the contents later, let's merge the pull request for now so we can continue with the course.

Reopen the pull request and merge it. I'll respond then. 
You took an action I didn't expect. I was looking for you to {{ expected }}.
## Step 8: Add information about your organization's license recommendations

Licensing can be one of the most challenging aspects of open source for enterprises. Successful open source organizations have policies that clarify their position on licenses for projects they are consuming, contributing to, and maintaining.

### Partners in this process

You will want to @ mention your legal team here as your partners in this step.

### Why are licenses important?

The opensource.guide article on [The Legal Side of Open Source](https://opensource.guide/legal/) is an excellent resource to share on why licensing is important.

In short, if a project does not have a license, it is considered copyrighted work and cannot truly be open source. Investing some time in the early stages of your program to identify the licenses you will use or accept will pay off down the line.

### Your license policy

Your license policy will consist of three distinct groups of licenses:

- **Consuming:** These are the licenses on the open source projects you consume internally.
- **Contributing:** These are the licenses you are willing to accept on projects your employees may contribute to as part of their work. This is likely to be a subset of those in the consuming category.
- **Releasing:** These are the license types approved for use on projects owned by your organization. There are typically different licenses for different types of content. For example, written documentation may use different licenses than software.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a license

We have created a template license policy for you in this pull request.  Work with your legal team to complete the following steps:

1. Identify your organization's preferred open source license for projects it is releasing and add these to the `license-policy.md` document in this pull request.
1. Evaluate [common open source licenses](https://choosealicense.com/appendix/) and decide which you are willing to accept for projects consumed and contributed to. Add these to the license-policy.md.
1. Define and document the process you will use to  enforce your license policy.
1. When you're ready to move on, merge this pull request.

<hr>
<h3 align="center">I'll respond when you merge this pull request.</h3>
Great! Let's go to the [next pull request]({{ url }}).
It looks like you closed this pull request without merging, but I wasn't expecting that! Even if you want to edit the contents later, let's merge the pull request for now so we can continue with the course.

Reopen the pull request and merge it. I'll respond then. 
You took an action I didn't expect. I was looking for you to {{ expected }}.
## Step 9: Issue template for using open source

This pull request adds an issue template that can be customized for use when team members wish to begin using a new open source project in their work. Not all organizations will want to track these requests and may choose instead to convert this to a self serve checklist.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add an issue template for customized use

1. Customize the template in this pull request to reflect the aspects of project health that are important for your team members to consider.
1. Add a checklist per your internal processes.
1. When you're ready to move on, merge this pull request.

<hr>
<h3 align="center">I'll respond when you merge this pull request.</h3>
Great! Let's go to the [next pull request]({{ url }}).
It looks like you closed this pull request without merging, but I wasn't expecting that! Even if you want to edit the contents later, let's merge the pull request for now so we can continue with the course.

Reopen the pull request and merge it. I'll respond then. 
You took an action I didn't expect. I was looking for you to {{ expected }}.
## Step 10: Help others create great `README`s

This pull request adds a template README file that serves as a starting point for team members who are open sourcing their projects. Creating a template is a great way to add some subtle branding elements!

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a template README

1. In this pull request, add appropriate branding elements.
1. Work with your editorial team to draft welcoming content for this template README.
1. When you're ready to move on, merge this pull request.
