# Welcome!

Hello @{{user.login}}, I'm so excited to teach you about Design Thinking! ðŸ˜„

This repository will be a working website that you can publish as your own Design Thinking landing page.

![toolkit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/76346666-ff0a4380-62ca-11ea-8609-408ca9126622.png)

As we work, we'll create a resource that others can use within your organization. This repository will be useful even after you finish this course.

This is how this course will move along:

- Every new issue or pull request will start with a challenge question
- You'll answer the challenge question _(don't worry, there are no right or wrong answers!)_
- The question will highlight the importance of each topic in Design Thinking
- The related Pull Request will add the resources for that topic to the toolkit
- When we're finished, we'll publish the toolkit using GitHub Pages


### Challenge question
Now let's try your first challenge question!

Design Thinking focuses on using the newest technologies to solve problems.

- [ ] True
- [ ] False

Our first pull request introduces Design Thinking in more detail.

### Challenge question

Design Thinking emphasizes delivering a good tool to users faster, rather than waiting on the completion of the perfect tool.

- [ ] True - putting a good, functional, tool in the hands of users quickly is more valuable than delivering a perfect tool when it's too late.
- [ ] False -  users should not compromise on the perfect tool to get something more quickly.

### Answer :crystal_ball:

**Design Thinking** does not focus on technology.  It is _human_-centric. It puts people first, before thinking about technology, to enable them to achieve more.  

This approach leads to more meaningful and innovative solutions, regardless of industry.

### Answer :crystal_ball:

**User-Centric** design enables the continous delivery of value to users. This means that putting a good, functional, tool in the hands of users quickly is more valuable than delivering a perfect tool when it's too late. 

Design Thinking accomplishes this by establishing the boundaries of the product early through the definition of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
Once the MVP is delivered, the team continues to iterate on the solution, incrementally improving and enhancing it by leveraging continous feedback from users and stakeholders.

In Design Thinking, human-centered design begins with Desirability.  The convergence of user need,  business viability, and technical & financial feasibility outlines the solution.

This pull request is about the five phases of Design Thinking.  These phases are based on three core principles.  

So far we've learned that Design Thinking is, at it's heart, User-Centric.  We've also talked about the concept of putting a Minimum Viable Product in the hands of users quickly in order to gain insight for solutioning.  Despite Dilbert's example, the designer must always remain focused on the needs of the user.

### Challenge question

Based on the information we've covered so far, what principles do you think might be important to Design Thinking?

### Answer :crystal_ball:
There are many important ideas and principles when utilizing Design Thinking.  At its core though, it's User-Centric. Therefore the most important characteristic of a solution is that it meets the needs of the User.  To ensure solutions achieve this objective, the three fundamental principles of Design Thinking guide teams through the process of defining the MVP, and then iteratively improving and enhancing it to achieve the final product.

These three principles are:
1. Empathy
2. Ideation
3. Experimentation

You'll read more detail about these principles when reviewing this pull request. The most important thing to know is that these three principles translate into the five phases of Design Thinking:

1. Empathize
2. Define 
3. Ideate 
4. Prototype 
5. Test

This pull request is about the first phase of Design Thinking: **Empathy**.  

### Challenge question


Arguably, empathy is the most important stage of Design Thinking.  The purpose of this stage is to gain an empathic understanding of the problem at hand. 

Which of the following methods should a designer use to derive insights into user needs? 

- [ ] Observation
- [ ] Engagement
- [ ] Immersion

### Answer :crystal_ball:
All of those methods are important to gaining an empathic understanding of the problem at hand, so all of the answers are right.  

The designer must:
1. **Observe** users and stakeholders in their daily work.  Observation often provides the most objective identification of the problem requiring a solution
2. **Engage** users and stakeholders in interviews and conversations to develop the best possible understanding of their needs and objectives
3. **Immerse** themselves in the physical environment of the users

You'll read more detail about how to use empathy to design meaningful solutions in this pull request, which also includes a case study.

This pull request is about the **Define & Ideate** phases of Design Thinking.  

### Challenge question

We've learned that Design Thinking is all about users.  With that in mind, which of the following problem statements, based on the case study from our previous pull request, is more effective?

- [ ] We need a system to ingest and consolidate road maintenance issues from multiple sources and in many formats.
- [ ] The citizens in our town need to easily report road issues and follow the progress of repairs.

<hr>
<h3 align="center">I'll respond when you check one of the boxes above.</h3>

### Answer :crystal_ball:
That's right! The second statement is much more likely to result in an innovative and valuable solution for the citizens. 

Such statements are created in the Define phase (phase 2) of Design Thinking.  In this phase, designers gather and analyze all of the information collected during the Empathize phase.  By identifying pain points and patterns in the information, a clear definition of the problem is crafted.

After the problem has been defined, designers can begin to generate ideas for a solution.  This is phase 3 - Ideate.  In this phase innovation & creativity are the most important factors!  To transition to the Ideate phase from the Define phase, teams often ask "how might we..."

This pull request is about the **Prototype & Test** phases of Design Thinking. Let's kick this topic off with a challenge question! 


Only high-fidelity prototypes are of value in Design Thinking.

- [ ] True, it's worth the time to always build out the most accurate simulation of the final product as possible. 
- [ ] False, quickly generating even the simplest prototype allows teams to gather feedback faster.

### Answer :crystal_ball:
It's false! One of the main reasons for prototyping is to _fail fast_.  Even a simple pencil & paper prototype can help teams to discover that they're on the wrong track.  As prototypes evolve user testing becomes more involved, but their feedback should be incorporated right from the beginning.  Prototyping allows for this kind of continuous feedback loop with users and other stakeholders from the start.

This approach helps teams avoid getting stuck in limbo or "analysis paralysis" like Dilbert's colleagues.
